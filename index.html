        <p>
          My design style blends elegance and creativity, with a deep
          appreciation for the beauty of simplicity. I gravitate toward refined
          serif typefaces, soft pastel color palettes, and carefully crafted
          mockups that bring each project to life. Whether I'm sketching by hand
          or designing digitally, my focus is on creating thoughtful visuals
          that tell a story, evoke emotion, and reflect intentional detail in
          every element.
